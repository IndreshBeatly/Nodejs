Named exports and defaut exports are the 2 types of exporting but what are the difference between them ?

NAMED EXPORTS :
1. you can export one or more things by names and import one ro more named exports in different files
2. we must use the exact same names while importing them (or use "as" to rename)
3. It is useful when we need to export several utilities or function


-> EXPORTING NAMED EXPORTS : 
export const add = (a,b)=>a+b;
export const multiply = (a.b)=>a*b;


-> IMPORTING NAMED EXPORTS : 
import {add,multiply} from './utils.js'
console.log(add(2,3))

DEFAULT EXPORTS :
1.In defult export you can only export one main thing from a file 
2.You can import it using any name you like since that file exports only 1 function
3.This is useful when a module focuses on a single main value or function

-> EXPORTING DEFAULT EXPORTS (say filename is logger.js)
export defaut fucntion log(message){
    console.log(`log:${message}`)
}

-> IMPORTING DEFAULT EXPORTS 
import abc from './logger.js';
log("Hello");
